# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-11)

**Core value:** Any agent × any model × any user, in one click — agent-agnostic install pipeline is the differentiator that must work.
**Current focus:** Phase 22 (channels-v0.2) parent close-out + next milestone phase selection

## Current Position

**Phase 22c (oauth-google) — SPEC'd, ready for /gsd-discuss-phase** at commit `d9863d2`.

### Stack of completed work this session (2026-04-19)

| Phase / Task | Status | Commit | What landed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 22b (agent-event-stream) | COMPLETE | `eb06c5a` | SC-03 unblocked: Gate A 15/15 + Gate B 5/5 PASS in `e2e-report.json`; verifier 21/21 truths PASSED; 9 plans across 5 waves |
| Quick task `260419-moq` (dashboard real-API) | COMPLETE | `2260dad`, `3520834`, `2e9e3be` | `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` now fetches real `/v1/agents` (59 real rows); Stop button wired to POST /v1/agents/:id/stop with Bearer prompt + 2s status polling; mockAgents + Agent interface + toggleAgentStatus + deleteAgent removed |
| Phase 22c (oauth-google) | SPEC'd | `d9863d2` | 8 falsifiable requirements + 12 acceptance criteria + 3 locked decisions (server-table sessions, purge ANONYMOUS via alembic 006, authlib); ambiguity 0.16 |

### 📍 RESUME ANCHOR — READ AFTER /clear

**The next command is:**
```
/gsd-discuss-phase 22c-oauth-google
```

**Read these files in this order on resume (after /clear):**

1. `memory/MEMORY.md` (auto-loaded; index of all memories)
2. `memory/project_phase_22c_handoff.md` — full Phase 22c handoff, locked decisions, OAuth credentials location
3. `.planning/phases/22c-oauth-google/22c-SPEC.md` — sealed contract (8 requirements + 3 decisions + boundaries)
4. `memory/project_phase_22b_handoff.md` — what just shipped (Phase 22b SC-03 GREEN)
5. `memory/feedback_worktree_breaks_for_live_infra.md` — Option B pattern for live-infra plans (use when applicable in 22c)
6. `memory/feedback_test_everything_before_planning.md` — golden rule #5 (spike-first); apply BEFORE sealing 22c plans
7. `.planning/audit/ACTION-LIST.md` — line 108 says OAuth is the single biggest unblocker (gates 4 frontend pages + 8 backend endpoints)
8. `api_server/src/api_server/services/crypto.py` — reusable age-KEK pattern for refresh-token encryption-at-rest
9. `frontend/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — currently hardcodes "Alex Chen"; 22c replaces with real `/v1/users/me`

### Live infra state (preserved between /clear)

- API server runs at http://localhost:8000 with `{"ok":true}` healthz
- Postgres at deploy-postgres-1; agent_events table exists (alembic 004 applied)
- 59 agents currently in `agent_instances` keyed to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` — Phase 22c alembic 006 will purge these
- Frontend dev server may or may not be running; restart with: `cd frontend && pnpm dev`
- All required env vars present in `deploy/.env.prod` (gitignored): POSTGRES_PASSWORD, AP_CHANNEL_MASTER_KEY, AP_SYSADMIN_TOKEN, AP_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, AP_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, AP_OAUTH_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI

### Local dev stack restart (if needed after /clear)

```bash
cd /Users/fcavalcanti/dev/agent-playground

# Bring up the prod-shaped local stack (uses deploy/.env.prod for substitution)
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.prod \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.local.yml \
  up -d

# Verify
curl -s http://localhost:8000/healthz   # → {"ok":true}

# Frontend dev (from project root)
cd frontend && pnpm dev   # → http://localhost:3000
```

### Open backlog (per ACTION-LIST.md after Phase 22c)

- 22c.1: GitHub OAuth (after Google shape proven)
- Dashboard sub-pages: `/dashboard/agents`, `/dashboard/agents/[id]`, `/dashboard/analytics`, `/dashboard/api-keys`, `/dashboard/billing`, `/dashboard/notifications`, `/dashboard/profile`, `/dashboard/settings` (all currently mocked)
- Backend Rule-2 cleanup: `GET /v1/personalities` + `RecipeSummary.tagline` + `RecipeSummary.accent` (kills 3 client-side catalogs)
- B1: `pass_if` field always NULL in RunResponse (low-pri user-facing bug)
- Gate C manual checklist run before any release tag (`test/sc03-gate-c.md`)

Execution summary (2026-04-18):

- Wave 1: 22-01 (v0.2 schema + JSON Schema + RecipeSummary surface) + 22-02 (alembic 003 agent_containers + age-KEK crypto) — merged at 439d3b5
- Wave 2: 22-03 (runner `run_cell_persistent`/`stop_persistent`/`exec_in_persistent`) + 22-04 (async bridge wrappers `execute_persistent_{start,stop,status,exec}`) — merged at 9784615
- Wave 3: 22-05 (4 HTTP endpoints /v1/agents/:id/{start,stop,status,channels/:cid/pair}) — merged at 60496b2
- Wave 4: 22-06 (frontend Step 2.5 + PairingModal + TS types, Rule-2 dumb-client verified) — merged at d27f288
- Wave 5: 22-07 Tasks 1+2 (test/lib/telegram_harness.py + test/e2e_channels_v0_2.sh) — merged at a38f74d

### SC-03 blocker (2026-04-18 empirical finding)

First supervised run surfaced a plan-level design flaw in Plan 22-07:
Telegram's `getUpdates` is single-consumer, so the harness and the hermes
container fight each other over the bot token. Bot never sees the test
ping; harness times out. Full writeup:
`.planning/phases/22-channels-v0.2/22-SC03-DESIGN-FLAW.md`.

What's proven live against the local stack:

- `POST /v1/runs` hermes+haiku-4.5 via OpenRouter → PASS (20.51s)
- `POST /v1/agents/:id/start` with Telegram creds → container running, boot ~11s
- `POST /v1/agents/:id/stop` → clean reap, no dangling containers
- Age-KEK crypto round-trips (with `AP_CHANNEL_MASTER_KEY` set in shell env)
- All 4 new `/v1/agents/...` routes exposed via OpenAPI

What blocks: the test harness can't observe bot replies. Fix = Phase 22b
(agent event stream via docker log parsing → Postgres → `GET /v1/agents/:id/events`).

### Second bug fixed inline (2026-04-18)

MATRIX in `test/e2e_channels_v0_2.sh` used `openrouter/anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`
as the model id — OpenRouter rejects the `openrouter/` prefix. Correct
form is `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`. Fix committed.

### Local-dev runtime state (for repro after /clear)

- API server container: rebuilt from HEAD (Phase 22 code baked in)
- `AP_CHANNEL_MASTER_KEY` — required in shell env before `docker compose up`
  (NOT written to `deploy/.env.prod`; per-laptop per CLAUDE.md rule)

- `.env.local` has `TELEGRAM_USER_CHAT_ID` — the script expects `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`,
  alias with `export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="$TELEGRAM_USER_CHAT_ID"`

Progress (2026-04-18):

- All 5 recipes carry v0.2-draft `persistent:` + `channels.telegram`
  blocks with `verified_cells[]` from empirical Telegram round-trips.

- hermes / picoclaw / nullclaw / nanobot: FULL_PASS via OpenRouter.
- openclaw: FULL_PASS via Anthropic direct; `provider_compat.
  deferred: [openrouter]` due to isolated upstream plugin bug in
  image 2026.4.15-beta.1 (LLM calls abort pre-flight with
  attempts: []; Anthropic direct works end-to-end).

- Canonical docs URLs commented on each recipe (kept in sync when
  recipe changes).

- Bespoke per-agent recon methodology validated — doc-only recon
  (CHANNEL-RECON.md) superseded by empirical per-agent verification
  (schema-from-reality notes live in each recipe).

Phase 20 (frontend-alicerce) — EXECUTED separately on 2026-04-17
(Playground UI banho de loja + inline ModelBrowser + higher-contrast
primitives shipped in commit a3c95fe).

Desiccated audit (2026-04-18) — `.planning/audit/` now holds three
FROZEN inventory docs:

- BACKEND-DESICCATED.md (9 routes, 7 services, 4 middleware, status
  classified; 5 top gaps identified; production-ready foundation)

- FRONTEND-DESSICATED.md (32 pages + 15 components; 71% real / 29%
  mock; Rule-1/2/3 scorecard)

- ACTION-LIST.md (consolidated execution order — per user directive
  2026-04-18 EVERY mocked page gets real backend wiring, zero
  deletions; /signup is the only open decision pending OAuth landing)

Backend scope grew to ~14 new endpoints across OAuth, users, api-keys
(age-encrypted), analytics aggregation, Stripe billing, notifications,
agent runs history. Multi-phase work ordered after OAuth unblock.

## 📍 RESUME ANCHOR — READ THIS FIRST AFTER /clear

**Primary resume files (read in this order):**

1. `.planning/phases/22-channels-v0.2/22-SC03-DESIGN-FLAW.md` — why
   Phase 22a can't close on its own and what blocks 15/15 round-trips

2. `.planning/phases/22b-agent-event-stream/CONTEXT.md` — proposed
   architecture for the SC-03 fix (docker-log → Postgres → API → harness)

3. `.planning/audit/ACTION-LIST.md` — what to build after 22b
   (prioritized per-page with real endpoint specs; OAuth still pending)

4. `.planning/phases/22-channels-v0.2/22-CONTEXT.md` — Phase 22a scope
   (reference only — 6 of 7 plans already shipped)

5. `memory/MEMORY.md` — updated with 22a-completed + 22b-proposed entries

**Next commands:**

1. `/gsd-discuss-phase 22b-agent-event-stream` — challenge or confirm
   the architecture in `22b/CONTEXT.md`, gather gray-area questions.

2. `/gsd-plan-phase 22b-agent-event-stream` — produce PLAN files.
3. `/gsd-execute-phase 22b-agent-event-stream` — ship it.
4. Rerun `bash test/e2e_channels_v0_2.sh` — closes SC-03, unblocks Phase 22 exit.

**Parallel (OAuth track, unchanged from previous plan):**

- `/gsd-spec-phase 22c-oauth` — spec OAuth (Google + GitHub),
  `/v1/users/me`, session cookie. Blocks 11 dashboard pages.

**Local-dev env for repro:**

```bash
export AP_CHANNEL_MASTER_KEY="2JAvJ9FwihbRyukvXDBnqVEK2Umf5ibHEy7KsFq5gTU="
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="$TELEGRAM_USER_CHAT_ID"
cd deploy && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d
```

- Quick cleanup wins (can ship anytime): GET /v1/personalities +
  drop frontend PERSONALITIES catalog; add tagline/accent fields
  to RecipeSummary + drop frontend maps; fix pass_if NULL bug (B1).

**The next command is:** `/gsd-execute-phase 22a` — execute 7
PLAN files already sealed under `.planning/phases/22-channels-v0.2/`
(schema formalization, runner persistent mode, API endpoints,
frontend Step 2.5, E2E smoke). All spike-verified (G1..G5 findings
absorbed), plan-checker PASS after I1..I3 contract revisions.

Read files in this order after /clear:

1. `./CLAUDE.md` (golden rules at the top — #2 "dumb client, intelligence in the API" and #3 "ship when stack works locally e2e" are load-bearing for this phase)
2. `.planning/phases/20-frontend-alicerce/20-CONTEXT.md` (14 decisions + SC-01..SC-11 — the exit gate)
3. `.planning/phases/20-frontend-alicerce/20-RESEARCH.md` (concrete patterns: api.ts extension diff, parseApiError union, useRetryCountdown, BYOK hardening, 8 pitfalls)
4. `.planning/phases/20-frontend-alicerce/20-UI-SPEC.md` (30 locked copy strings, Tailwind classes, 5-state + 6-error ASCII wireframes)
5. `.planning/phases/20-frontend-alicerce/20-PATTERNS.md` (6 analogs — dev-login-form.tsx is the exact structural analog for playground-form.tsx)
6. `.planning/phases/20-frontend-alicerce/20-01-PLAN.md` through `20-05-PLAN.md` (5 PLANs in 3 waves)
7. `memory/feedback_dumb_client_no_mocks.md` (the principle that created this phase)
8. `.planning/STATE.md` (this file)

### Wave execution order (Phase 20)

| Wave | Plans | Files | Summary |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | 20-01, 20-02 | `frontend/lib/api.ts` + `api-types.ts` / delete mock tree (5 components + homepage section) | Parallel — no file overlap |
| 2 | 20-03, 20-04 | `playground-form.tsx` / `run-result-card.tsx` | Parallel after Wave 1 |
| 3 | 20-05 | `playground/page.tsx` + SUMMARY + STATE | Sequential; **human-verify SC-11 gate** (the Phase 19 deploy unblocker) |

## Quick Tasks Completed

| ID | Date | Description | Notes |
|----|------|-------------|-------|
| 260414-mwo | 2026-04-14 | Import v0 frontend as `frontend/` monorepo member | v0 tree at `/frontend`, ported `api.ts`/`middleware.ts`/`dev-login-form.tsx` from legacy `/web`, added Makefile targets. `/web` still on disk — deletion deferred to Phase 3 after new tree is verified end-to-end. |

### ⚠️ Phase 02 Reshape (2026-04-14) — READ BEFORE PLANNING

The original Phase 02 in the roadmap bundled substrate + full hardening. After a discuss-phase session, the user challenged whether the hardening half actually moved the project hypothesis forward. Conclusion: it did not, and it should land against a known-working substrate rather than a speculative one.

**Phase 02 now ships:**

1. `ap-base` image (tini PID 1 + tmux chat/shell windows + ttyd on loopback + MSV entrypoint/gosu pattern ported from `meusecretariovirtual/infra/picoclaw/`)
2. Sandbox options wired into `pkg/docker/runner.go` `RunOptions` as fields (SeccompProfile, ReadOnlyRootfs, Tmpfs, CapDrop, NoNewPrivs, Runtime, NetworkMode, PidsLimit, Memory, CPUs) — safe defaults applied at call sites, no custom seccomp JSON yet
3. Deterministic container naming `playground-<user_uuid>-<session_uuid>` + validator + helper in runner.go
4. Two pre-built recipe images: **picoclaw** (Go CLI, pinned SHA from `/Users/fcavalcanti/dev/picoclaw`, `stdin_fifo` chat path) + **Hermes** (Python 3.11, pinned SHA from `github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent`, MIT, TUI-first, multi-channel daemon disabled via pre-populated `~/.hermes/cli-config.yaml`, backend forced to `local`)
5. **Minimal non-durable session API stubs** pulled forward from Phase 5 scope: `POST /api/sessions`, `POST /api/sessions/:id/message` (synchronous FIFO bridge via `docker exec`), `DELETE /api/sessions/:id`. Direct runner.go calls — **no Temporal in Phase 2.** Phase 5 upgrades internals with SessionSpawn/SessionDestroy workflows, HTTP contract stays stable.
6. Dev BYOK via `AP_DEV_BYOK_KEY` env → tmpfs `/run/secrets/*_key` injection (file-based mechanism is Phase 2; Phase 3 replaces the source with the encrypted vault).
7. Hardcoded recipe structs in new `internal/recipes/` package (Phase 4 replaces with YAML schema + loader)
8. New migration `0002_sessions.sql` — `sessions` table (id, user_id, recipe_name, model_provider, model_id, container_id, status, created_at, updated_at). One-active-per-user enforced via Postgres partial unique index.
9. **Hypothesis proof smoke test:** `make smoke-test` or equivalent runs curl against the API, starts both agents, exchanges a real message with a real Anthropic model via BYOK, tears down cleanly, asserts no dangling `playground-*` containers. The curl output IS the demo — no browser UX until Phase 5.

**Phase 02 does NOT ship (deferred to new Phase 7.5):**

- Custom seccomp profile JSON
- `ap-net` Docker bridge + iptables DOCKER-USER egress allowlist
- Falco or Tetragon + rule set + alerting sink
- Escape-test CI harness (mount/unshare/setns/docker.sock/evil egress)
- gVisor `runsc` install + per-recipe runtime selection (Spike 4 still pending — not a Phase 2 blocker anymore, only gates Phase 7.5 + Phase 8)

**Phase 7.5 (new, inserted 2026-04-14): Sandbox Hardening Spine.** Fills in every sandbox knob Phase 2 plumbed, against a known-working substrate, right before Phase 8 introduces the first untrusted-code path. Requirements moved there: SBX-02 (custom seccomp portion), SBX-04, SBX-06, SBX-07 (Falco portion), SBX-08.

**Critical forward-compatibility signals from discuss-phase (user verbatim):**

- *"API-driven start without Telegram is the hypothesis proof"* — Phase 2 completion gate is curl → real model response for both agents
- *"this list will grow"* — recipe abstraction must accept new agents as recipe YAML + Dockerfile, no code changes to `ap-base`, `runner.go`, or session handlers. Hermes being the architecturally hardest agent validates the pattern.
- *"Hermes is totally different from OpenClaw"* — OpenClaw (gateway-WebSocket, Node, pairing) vs Hermes (PTY TUI, Python 3.11, multi-channel daemon, six execution backends). Both must fit `ap-base` without special-casing. Hermes's chat bridge mechanism (PTY screen-scrape vs MCP via `mcp_serve.py` vs hypothetical CLI `--message` flag) is a Phase 2 **planning research** item.

**Full reshape rationale + every decision + canonical refs:** `.planning/phases/02-container-sandbox-spine/02-CONTEXT.md`

**Discussion audit trail:** `.planning/phases/02-container-sandbox-spine/02-DISCUSSION-LOG.md`

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20
- Average duration: ~25 min/plan (parallel waves; wall clock ~3h45m total)
- Total execution time: ~4 hours wall clock for Phase 01 end-to-end

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (locked)

From PROJECT.md Key Decisions:

- **Temporal is required** (overrides research's "drop Temporal" recommendation). Session create/destroy, recipe install, reconciliation = Temporal workflows. Workers must be running. **PROVEN in Phase 01:** PingPong workflow ran live against the cluster, 50ms, completed.
- **Go API + Next.js** mirrors MSV. `pkg/docker/runner.go` ported from MSV pattern but rewritten for the **Docker Engine SDK** (`github.com/moby/moby/client`) — explicitly NOT `os/exec` shelling. Verified clean.
- **Hetzner dedicated single host.** No K8s, no cloud-managed containers. docker-compose stack on host.
- **BYOK first-class.** Platform-billed mode via LiteLLM + Stripe credit ledger (Phase 6/7).
- **gVisor (`runsc`) mandatory for Phase 8** bootstrap path. Curated recipes may use plain `runc`.
- **Apache-2.0 OSS.** Monetization = hosted service.

### Phase 01 Outcomes (what now exists in the repo)

**Go API (`api/`):**

- Echo v4.15.1 + pgx v5.9.1 + Redis v9.18 + zerolog
- `cmd/server/main.go` boot: config → DB → Redis → migrations → server.New(...opts) → graceful shutdown
- `pkg/database/postgres.go` — pgxpool wrapper
- `pkg/redis/client.go` — Redis wrapper
- `pkg/migrate/` — embedded `//go:embed sql/*.sql` migrator with `pg_advisory_lock(8675309)` + per-migration tx (CR-04 fix). Baseline schema = users / user_sessions / agents (with partial unique index `idx_agents_one_active_per_user`).
- `pkg/docker/runner.go` — 396 lines, Docker Engine SDK (NOT os/exec). Run / Exec / Inspect / Stop / Remove + strict input validation (validateContainerID/validateImageName/validateEnvVar/validateMountPath). 49 unit tests + integration test (real Docker, alpine:3.19) all green.
- `internal/server/server.go` — `server.New(cfg, logger, checker, opts ...Option)` with **functional options pattern**. `WithDevAuth(...)` and `WithWorkers(WorkerManager)` are the two options. Plan 01-01 pre-declared the pattern so Plan 01-05 added Temporal without touching the New signature.
- `internal/handler/` — health (`/healthz` returning DB+Redis status), checker, devauth (POST /api/dev/login, POST /api/dev/logout, GET /api/me).
- `internal/middleware/auth.go` — `SessionProvider` interface (Phase 3 will swap goth in), HMAC-SHA256 signed `ap_session` cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax), `VerifyCookie` constant-time compare (CR-01 fix). Session secret length validated unconditionally (CR-02 fix).
- `internal/temporal/` — 3 workers (session/billing/reconciliation queues), 5 stub workflows (SessionSpawn, SessionDestroy, RecipeInstall, ReconcileContainers, ReconcileBilling) + PingPong proof. Workers.Start() rolls back partial startups (CR-03 fix). Empty TEMPORAL_HOST short-circuits to skip Temporal entirely (WR-01 fix).

**Next.js frontend (`web/`):**

- Next 16.2 + React 19.2 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + Inter font + dark mode default + emerald accent
- `src/app/page.tsx` — auth-gated landing. **Uses versioned auth re-fetch pattern**: `authVersion` state bumped by `refreshAuth` callback re-runs the /api/me effect. (Was using `router.refresh()` which only re-runs server components — fixed in `eecbef4`.)
- `src/components/dev-login-form.tsx` — emerald 44px touch-target button, calls `onLoginSuccess` callback prop after POST /api/dev/login
- `src/components/top-bar.tsx` — sticky top bar, sign-out icon, calls `onSignOut` callback prop
- `src/lib/api.ts` — `apiGet/apiPost` with `credentials: 'include'` and typed `ApiError`/`SessionUser`
- `src/middleware.ts` — Next middleware (no-op for Phase 01, set up for Phase 02+)
- `next.config.ts` — rewrites `/api/*` → `http://localhost:8080/api/*` for local dev
- **CRITICAL:** `web/AGENTS.md` says "This is NOT the Next.js you know" — Next 16 has breaking changes; future agents must read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before touching Next-specific code. Already burned by NODE_ENV=development causing build failure during 01-03.

**Infrastructure:**

- `docker-compose.dev.yml` — Postgres 17 + Redis 7 + **Temporal 1.29.3** + **Temporal UI 2.34.0** (CR-05 fix: pinned versions). All ports `127.0.0.1`-bound. `condition: service_healthy` on temporal→postgresql. **Removed `DYNAMIC_CONFIG_FILE_PATH`** env var (compose fix `480d5b4`) — image doesn't ship the file and we don't mount it.
- `docker-compose.yml` — production Temporal + UI, `network_mode: host`, same pinned versions
- `deploy/dev/init-db.sh` — creates `agent_playground` DB after first compose up
- `deploy/hetzner/` — 6 idempotent provisioning scripts: bootstrap.sh, install-docker.sh (with userns-remap), install-postgres.sh, install-redis.sh, install-temporal.sh, harden-ufw.sh (default-deny, 22 + 443 only)
- `.env.example` — all env vars documented

**Spike report (`.planning/research/SPIKE-REPORT.md`):**

- **Spike 1** (per-agent HTTPS_PROXY vs *_BASE_URL): OpenClaw + PicoClaw both honor BOTH; HTTPS_PROXY env wins for v1 transparent metering proxy. Hermes/HiClaw/NanoClaw deferred to Phase 4 recipe authoring (sources not local).
- **Spike 2** (chat_io.mode per agent): OpenClaw = `gateway-websocket`; PicoClaw = `cli-stdio` + per-channel adapters. Drives `chat_io.mode` enum addition to Phase 4 recipe schema.
- **Spike 3** (tmux + named-pipe RTT): **min 69µs / p50 85µs / p95 138µs / p99 0.19ms / max 238µs** measured locally in alpine:3.20 Docker. PASS — 262× headroom under 50ms budget.
- **Spike 4** (gVisor runsc on Hetzner): NOT EXECUTED. Needs SSH to prod box (gVisor is Linux-only, can't run from macOS). Exact commands documented in §"Spike 4 — Exact commands to run on the Hetzner host". Result template at end of report — fill kernel version, runsc version, PASS/FAIL.

### Code Review Outcomes

`01-REVIEW.md` (initial): 5 critical / 6 warnings / 5 info
`01-REVIEW-FIX.md`: 11/11 critical+warning fixed in single pass, 0 skipped. Info findings deferred (run `/gsd-code-review-fix 01 --all` to address).

Notable info-severity items deferred:

- INF-01: HMAC compare logic duplicated in 2 places (now uses shared VerifyCookie after CR-01, but constant could be extracted)
- INF-02: Related — VerifyCookie naming
- INF-03: docker-compose missing temporal healthcheck (currently relies on restart: on-failure)
- INF-04: API_BASE empty string in `web/src/lib/api.ts` could be more defensive
- INF-05: SQL injection risk in install-postgres.sh if operator passes hostile password (low-prio; operator controls input)

### Verification Outcomes

`01-VERIFICATION.md`: status `human_needed`, score 9/10 must-haves verified.
`01-HUMAN-UAT.md`: 2 items

1. ✅ **CLEARED** — Visual mobile-first frontend verification (375px viewport) — passed live test after `eecbef4` fix to login/logout reload bug
2. ⏳ **PENDING** — Spike 4: gVisor runsc on Hetzner — needs human SSH

### Bugs Found and Fixed During Phase 01 Execution

1. **`480d5b4 fix(01-04): drop unmountable DYNAMIC_CONFIG_FILE_PATH from compose files`** — Temporal compose env referenced a config file not shipped in image. Found while testing.
2. **`eecbef4 fix(01-03): re-check auth on login/logout via callback instead of router.refresh`** — Frontend used router.refresh() but page is a client component. Caught by visual UAT.
3. The 11 code-review fixes (CR-01..05, WR-01..06) — see `01-REVIEW-FIX.md`.

### Pending Todos

- **Spike 4 (gVisor on Hetzner)** — human action required. SSH to Hetzner host, run `runsc install` + `docker run --runtime=runsc alpine:3.20 echo hello`. Update `.planning/research/SPIKE-REPORT.md` §"Spike 4 — Result template" with kernel version, runsc version, PASS/FAIL. Result gates Phase 8 sandbox tier: if FAIL, Phase 8 must pivot from gVisor to Sysbox-only or microVMs.
- **5 info-severity code review items** deferred — run `/gsd-code-review-fix 01 --all` if/when desired (low priority).

### Blockers/Concerns

- **None blocking Phase 02.** Spike 4 result is needed for Phase 8 architecture decision but does NOT block Phase 02 (Recipes & Sandbox). Phase 02 can proceed assuming gVisor works; if it later fails, Phase 8 plans get adjusted.

## Local Dev Stack — How to Bring It Back Up

```bash

# Compose stack (currently running — postgres + redis + temporal + temporal UI)

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
./deploy/dev/init-db.sh   # only on first start

# Go API

cd api && \
  AP_DEV_MODE=true \
  AP_SESSION_SECRET=test-secret-that-is-at-least-32-characters-long \
  DATABASE_URL="postgres://temporal:temporal@localhost:5432/agent_playground?sslmode=disable" \
  REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 \
  TEMPORAL_HOST=localhost:7233 \
  TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=default \
  API_PORT=8080 \
  go run ./cmd/server/

# Next.js

cd web && pnpm dev

# Trigger PingPong workflow (proves Temporal end-to-end)

docker exec agent-playground-temporal-1 sh -c 'temporal --address $(hostname -i):7233 workflow execute --type PingPong --task-queue session --workflow-id ping-pong-test --input "\"hello\""'
```

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-18T03:14:21.826Z

Stopped at: context exhaustion at 90% (2026-04-18)

**Next command:** `/gsd-insert-phase 02.5 "Recipe Manifest Reshape" --discuss`

**Primary resume artifact:** `.planning/research/PHASE-02.5-PREP.md` — read first after /clear.

### Reading order for a fresh session after /clear

1. `.planning/STATE.md` (this file) — top-level situational awareness + Phase 2 reshape summary above
2. `.planning/phases/02-container-sandbox-spine/02-CONTEXT.md` — **source of truth for Phase 2 decisions**. Every decision from the discuss-phase is in `<decisions>`; every doc downstream agents need is in `<canonical_refs>`; every deferred idea is in `<deferred>`.
3. `.planning/phases/02-container-sandbox-spine/02-DISCUSSION-LOG.md` — full Q&A audit trail (optional; use if you need to understand WHY a decision was made, not just WHAT was decided)
4. `.planning/ROADMAP.md` §Phase 2 — reshaped success criteria + requirement mapping (points at 02-CONTEXT.md)
5. `.planning/ROADMAP.md` §Phase 7.5 — new phase inserted during reshape; holds the deferred hardening work
6. `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — SBX-02 partial, SBX-04/06/07/08 moved to Phase 7.5
7. `.planning/research/SPIKE-REPORT.md` — Phase 1 spike findings (Hermes gap; Phase 2 planning must extend Spike 1+2 for Hermes)
8. `/Users/fcavalcanti/dev/meusecretariovirtual/infra/picoclaw/Dockerfile` + `entrypoint.sh` — MSV's battle-tested dockerized-agent pattern to port into `ap-base` (entry point, privilege drop via gosu, pre-populated config baked at build)

### Planning research items Phase 2 must resolve (flagged in 02-CONTEXT.md D-23)

- Hermes chat bridge mechanism: PTY screen-scrape vs MCP (via `mcp_serve.py`) vs hypothetical `hermes --message` non-interactive CLI flag. Fetch the `cli-config.yaml.example` from `github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent` to pin exact keys.
- Exact YAML keys in Hermes `cli-config.yaml` for (a) disabling Telegram/Discord/Slack/WhatsApp/Signal/SMS/Email/Matrix/Mattermost gateway daemons and (b) forcing `backend: local`.
- Commit SHAs to pin picoclaw and Hermes to (pick the latest stable at plan-writing time).
- Extend Spike 1 + Spike 2 for Hermes (currently picoclaw + OpenClaw only covered).

Resume file: None
